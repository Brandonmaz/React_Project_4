# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

The app:
The function of the app is a to-do list. In everyday life it is easy to forget things that you need to do throughout a day, a week and even a month. Our app is to help those of us that need to stay organized and get reminders of tasks we need to take care of.
Some features we wanted to add:
Authorization would help take this app to the next level. We will look into a way so that when a user logs in they see only the tasks they need to complete and not another user.
We wanted to have a separate area where if you finished a task it would goto a finished task section that worked with a checkbox. This would then end up in a separate row away from    tasks you still need to complete. Current function of the checkbox puts a line through the completed task. Unfortunately, we were unable to get this feature working with a ternary operator. We will look into how we can get this function to work in the future.
Finding a better way to hide the details/update entry. We tried with css but we were unsuccessful in hiding them. The idea was a hover effect over an arrow where once hovered on you could choose which option you want to select.
We chose a simple layout towards the end of the project. We wanted to add more layers to it but it either didn't work and we scrapped it or we ran out of time. With more ruby/rails knowledge I do not doubt that our original idea would be easy to create.
